# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers about the Prompt My Client React component.

## ü§î General Questions

### What is Prompt My Client React?

Prompt My Client React is a React component library that provides an AI-powered dropdown interface for text enhancement and transformation. It allows users to easily enhance, rewrite, or transform text content using various AI-powered prompts.

### What are the system requirements?

- React 18 or higher
- React DOM 18 or higher
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Is this component free to use?

Yes! The component is open-source and available under the MIT License, which means you can use it freely in both personal and commercial projects.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### How do I install the package?

```bash
npm install prompt-my-client-react
```

or

```bash
yarn add prompt-my-client-react
```

### Do I need to set up any API keys?

No, the component handles AI service integration internally. You just need to provide the text and handle the response callback.

### Can I use this with Next.js?

Absolutely! The component works perfectly with Next.js, Create React App, Vite, and any other React setup.

## üéØ Usage Questions

### How do I handle the AI response?

You provide a callback function via the `aiResponseCallback` prop:

```tsx
const handleAIResponse = (response: string) => {
  if (response) {
    setText(response);
    console.log("AI Response:", response);
  }
};

<AIDropDown 
  text={text} 
  aiResponseCallback={handleAIResponse} 
/>
```

### What happens if there's no text to process?

If the `text` prop is empty or undefined, the AI button will be disabled to prevent unnecessary API calls.

### Can I customize the prompt options?

Yes! You can provide your own custom prompt options:

```tsx
const customPrompts = [
  {
    prompt: 'Translate to Spanish',
    label: 'Spanish',
    tone: 'formal'
  }
];

<AIDropDown 
  text={text} 
  aiResponseCallback={handleAIResponse}
  promptOptions={customPrompts}
/>
```

## üé® Styling & Customization

### How do I change the button size?

Use the `size` prop with predefined values:

```tsx
<AIDropDown 
  text={text} 
  aiResponseCallback={handleAIResponse}
  size="38px"  // Small
  // size="48px"  // Medium (default)
  // size="52px"  // Large
/>
```

### Can I change the colors?

Yes! You can customize all aspects of the styling:

```tsx
<AIDropDown 
  text={text} 
  aiResponseCallback={handleAIResponse}
  buttonStyle={{
    background: '#ff6b6b',
    color: 'white'
  }}
  dropdownStyle={{
    background: '#ffffff',
    border: '2px solid #ff6b6b'
  }}
/>
```

### How do I make it match my app's theme?

Use the styling props to match your design system:

```tsx
<AIDropDown 
  text={text} 
  aiResponseCallback={handleAIResponse}
  buttonStyle={{
    background: 'var(--primary-color)',
    color: 'var(--text-on-primary)'
  }}
  dropdownStyle={{
    background: 'var(--surface-color)',
    border: `1px solid var(--border-color)`
  }}
/>
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### The component isn't rendering

Check these common issues:
1. Make sure you've imported the component correctly
2. Verify your React version is 18 or higher
3. Check that the package was installed successfully
4. Ensure you're providing the required props (`text` and `aiResponseCallback`)

### AI responses aren't working

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Verify the `text` prop contains the text you want to transform
2. Check that the `aiResponseCallback` function is properly defined
3. Ensure your internet connection is working
4. Check the browser console for any error messages

### Styling isn't applying correctly

Common styling issues:
1. Make sure you're using the correct prop names (`buttonStyle`, `dropdownStyle`, etc.)
2. Check that your CSS properties are valid
3. Verify that your custom styles aren't being overridden by CSS specificity
4. Try using `!important` for critical styles if needed

### The dropdown is positioned incorrectly

Positioning issues:
1. Check if the parent container has `position: relative`
2. Ensure there are no conflicting CSS transforms
3. Verify z-index values for proper layering
4. For mobile, consider using `position: fixed` for the dropdown

## üîÑ Integration Questions

### Can I use this with form libraries?

Yes! The component works great with React Hook Form, Formik, and other form libraries:

```tsx
import { useForm, Controller } from 'react-hook-form';

const { control, setValue, watch } = useForm();
const content = watch('content');

const handleAIResponse = (response: string) => {
  if (response) {
    setValue('content', response);
  }
};

<Controller
  name="content"
  control={control}
  render={({ field }) => (
    <div>
      <textarea {...field} />
      <AIDropDown 
        text={content} 
        aiResponseCallback={handleAIResponse}
      />
    </div>
  )}
/>
```

### Does it work with state management libraries?

Yes! You can use it with Redux, Zustand, Zustand, or any other state management solution:

```tsx
import { useStore } from 'zustand';

const { text, setText } = useStore();

const handleAIResponse = (response: string) => {
  if (response) {
    setText(response);
  }
};

<AIDropDown 
  text={text} 
  aiResponseCallback={handleAIResponse}
/>
```

### Can I use this in a server-side rendered app?

Yes! The component works with SSR frameworks like Next.js. Just make sure to handle the client-side AI interactions properly.

## üì± Mobile & Responsiveness

### How do I optimize for mobile?

Use mobile-specific styling:

```tsx
<AIDropDown 
  text={text} 
  aiResponseCallback={handleAIResponse}
  size="48px"
  dropdownStyle={{
    position: 'fixed',
    bottom: '80px',
    left: '20px',
    right: '20px',
    borderRadius: '16px',
    maxHeight: '60vh'
  }}
/>
```

### Does it work on touch devices?

Yes! The component is fully touch-friendly and includes proper touch event handling.

## üöÄ Performance Questions

### Is the component performant?

Yes! The component is optimized for performance:
- Only re-renders when necessary props change
- AI requests are debounced to prevent excessive API calls
- The dropdown is rendered conditionally
- Large text inputs are handled efficiently

### How do I optimize for large text inputs?

The component handles large text efficiently, but you can optimize further:
- Consider debouncing user input
- Use virtual scrolling for very long text
- Implement text chunking if needed

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Is my text data secure?

The component sends text to AI services for processing. Check the privacy policy of the AI service provider for details about data handling.

### Can I use this in production?

Yes! The component is production-ready and includes error handling, loading states, and graceful degradation.
